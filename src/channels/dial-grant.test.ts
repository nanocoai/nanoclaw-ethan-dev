/**
 * Security regression: the Dial adapter's inbound pairing path must never grant
 * a role. A matching 6-digit SMS proves the sender controls a phone, not that
 * they are the operator, so the adapter only records the sender as a candidate —
 * the operator-run setup wizard (setup/pair-dial.ts) is the sole owner-granting
 * authority. Before the fix, `consumePairing` self-granted `owner` whenever the
 * install had none, letting an inbound SMS take over the agent.
